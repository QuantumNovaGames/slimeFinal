# Slime Time

**Get Gooey, Get Victorious!**

Slime Time is a bouncy, squishy, 3D adventure where you take control of a determined little slime on a quest for... well, we're not sure what exactly, but it's definitely an adventure!

## Features

* **5 Slippery Levels:** Navigate through treacherous environments filled with traps, puzzles, and maybe a surprise or two.
* **Dynamic Enemies:** Outsmart a variety of quirky foes – they may be cute, but they pack a slimy punch!
* **Custom 3D Goodness:** Explore a vibrant world made with love (and a whole lot of Blender magic).

## How to Play

* Movement: Look around with mouse, WASD keys for foward, backward and strafe
* Jump: spacebar
* Special Ability: RMB to shoot slime!  Careful, each shot costs precious health!  Other hidden abilities in powerups around level!

## Additional Notes

* This project is in active development – expect updates, new levels, and even more slime-tastic features!
* System Requirements may vary depending on your build.

**Let the squishing commence!**
